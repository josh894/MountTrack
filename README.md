# MountTrack
Personal use World of Warcraft addon to track specific mounts.

## Dependencies
-   Ace3, LibDBIcon
-   These can both be found within the libs folder.

## Usage
-   Install and unzip into `\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns`
-   Once in game, list of mounts can be viewed clicking on the minimap tooltip.
-   To search the source of a specific mount, type `/mountT mountname` (Mount name is case sensitive).

## Editing for own-use
-   In Get_Mounts() the mount table is listed with mount IDs you wish to track.
-   IDs can be found on the mount's SPELL page on wowhead (Ex. https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288503/umber-nightsaber mount ID = 1203)
